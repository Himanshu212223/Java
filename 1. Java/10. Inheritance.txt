  	Inheritance :-
  	______________________________
  	
  	- When one class wants to get the properties of some another class, i.e., when child class
  		want to get the properties of Parent class, then, Inheritance is used.
  	
  	- extends is used to perform Inheritance.

	- Java follows Single level, Multi-level, and Hierarchical Inheritance (multiple classes can extends on class).
