# Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm (a way of writing and organizing code) that is based on the concept of objects.

- An object is like a real-world entity â€” it bundles data (fields/attributes) and the behaviors (methods/functions) that operate on that data into a single unit.

## Key Concepts of OOP:

### Class

- It is a blueprint or **template** for creating objects.

- Example: A Car class defines attributes like color, model, and methods like drive(), brake().

### Object

- An instance of a class (created from the blueprint).

- Example: A specific Car like a red Toyota Corolla.

### Encapsulation

- Wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) together into one unit (a class).

- Restricts direct access to some data for security.

- Example: Private fields with public getters/setters.

### Abstraction

- Hiding implementation details and showing only the necessary features.

- Example: You can use a car's drive() method without knowing how the engine works.

### Inheritance

- Mechanism to create a new class from an existing class, reusing its fields and methods.

- Example: ElectricCar can inherit from Car.

### Polymorphism

- Ability of objects to take many forms, usually by overriding methods.

- Example: The makeSound() method works differently in Dog and Cat.

## Why OOP?

- Organizes code in a modular way.

- Promotes reusability, scalability, and maintainability.

- Models real-world entities more naturally.
