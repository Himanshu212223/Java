# Socket Programming in Java

- Socket programming in Java enables communication between two devices over a network. 
- It allows data exchange between a client and a server using the `java.net package`. 
- Sockets serve as communication endpoints, providing the foundation for building distributed applications such as chat systems, file transfer utilities, and client-server applications.





# Client-Side Programming

## 1. Establish a Socket Connection

To connect to another machine we need a socket connection. 

A socket connection means both machines know each other’s IP address and TCP port. The java.net.Socket class is used to create a socket.

```
Socket socket = new Socket(“127.0.0.1”, 5000)
```

- **The first argument →** The IP address of Server i.e. 127.0.0.1  is the IP address of localhost, where code will run on the single stand-alone machine.

- **The second argument →** The TCP Port number (Just a number representing which application to run on a server. For example, HTTP runs on port 80. Port number can be from 0 to 65535)



## 2.Communication 
To exchange data over a socket connection, streams are used for input and output:

- **Input Stream →** Reads data coming from the socket.
- **Output Stream →** Sends data through the socket.

Example to access these streams:
```
// to read data

InputStream input = socket.getInputStream();  

// to send data

OutputStream output = socket.getOutputStream();
```


## 3. Closing the Connection

The socket connection is closed explicitly once the message to the server is sent.

```
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class Client {
  
    // Initialize socket and input/output streams
    private Socket s = null;
    private DataInputStream in = null;
    private DataOutputStream out = null;

    public Client(String addr, int port)
    {
        // Establish a connection
        try {
            s = new Socket(addr, port);
            System.out.println("Connected");

            // Takes input from terminal
            in = new DataInputStream(System.in);

            // Sends output to the socket
            out = new DataOutputStream(s.getOutputStream());
        }
        catch (UnknownHostException u) {
            System.out.println(u);
            return;
        }
        catch (IOException i) {
            System.out.println(i);
            return;
        }

        // String to read message from input
        String m = "";

        // Keep reading until "Over" is input
        while (!m.equals("Over")) {
            try {
                m = in.readLine();
                out.writeUTF(m);
            }
            catch (IOException i) {
                System.out.println(i);
            }
        }

        // Close the connection
        try {
            in.close();
            out.close();
            s.close();
        }
        catch (IOException i) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Client c = new Client("127.0.0.1", 5000);
    }
}
```


# Server-Side Programming

## 1. Establish a Socket Connection

To create a server application two sockets are needed. 

- **ServerSocket →** This socket waits for incoming client requests. It listens for connections on a specific port.
**Socket →** Once a connection is established, the server uses this socket to communicate with the client.



## 2. Communication
- Once the connection is established, you can send and receive data through the socket using streams.
- The getOutputStream() method is used to send data to the client.


## 3. Close the Connection 
Once communication is finished, it's important to close the socket and the input/output streams to free up resources.

Example - 
```
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public class Server {
  
    // Initialize socket and input stream
    private Socket s = null;
    private ServerSocket ss = null;
    private DataInputStream in = null;

    // Constructor with port
    public Server(int port) {
      
        // Starts server and waits for a connection
        try
        {
            ss = new ServerSocket(port);
            System.out.println("Server started");

            System.out.println("Waiting for a client ...");

            s = ss.accept();
            System.out.println("Client accepted");

            // Takes input from the client socket
            in = new DataInputStream(
                new BufferedInputStream(s.getInputStream()));

            String m = "";

            // Reads message from client until "Over" is sent
            while (!m.equals("Over"))
            {
                try
                {
                    m = in.readUTF();
                    System.out.println(m);

                }
                catch(IOException i)
                {
                    System.out.println(i);
                }
            }
            System.out.println("Closing connection");

            // Close connection
            s.close();
            in.close();
        }
        catch(IOException i)
        {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Server s = new Server(5000);
    }
}
```


Explanation: 

In the above example, we have implemented a server that listens on a specific port, accepts a client connection, and reads messages sent by the client. The server displays the messages until "Over" is received, after which it closes the connection and terminates.


## Run the Application

Open two windows one for Server and another for Client.

### 1. Run the Server
First run the Server application as:

```
$ java Server
```

Output:
```
Server started 
Waiting for a client ...
```

### 2. Run the Client

Then run the Client application on another terminal as
```
$ java Client
```
Output:
```
Connected 
```


### 3. Exchange Messages
Type messages in the Client window.
Messages will appear in the Server window.
Type "Over" to close the connection.
Here is a sample interaction:

Client:
```
Hello 

I made my first socket connection 

Over

Server:  

Hello 

I made my first socket connection 

Over 

Closing connection
```

Sending “Over” closes the connection between the Client and the Server just like said before. 

### Note : If you're using Eclipse or likes of such:

- Compile both of them on two different terminals or tabs
- Run the Server program first
- Then run the Client program
- Type messages in the Client Window which will be received and shown by the Server Window simultaneously.
- Type Over to end.
