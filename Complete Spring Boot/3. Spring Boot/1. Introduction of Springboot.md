# Spring Boot and its Layers

Create and download a sample Spring Boot Project from [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/).

Extract the downloaded file and import it as Existing Maven Project on IDE like Eclipse.

The Spring Boot expect you to keep you project structure like below-
```
project
|-- src/main/java
    |-- packageName
    |   |-- ProjectApplication.java
    |
    |-- packageName.entity
    |   |-- entityClass.java
    |
    |-- packageName.repository
    |   |-- entityRepositoryInterface.java
    |
    |-- packageName.service
    |   |-- serviceClass.java
```

## Layers of Spring Boot

1. **Persistence Layer** - This layer interacts with Databases like mySQL, MongoDB, etc. The persistence layer is the part of your Spring Boot application that deals with storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting data â€” usually from a database.

2. **Service Layer** - This layer is used to keep or write the business logics.

3. **Presentation Layer** - This layer is used to define the API endpoints which interacts with the UI.
