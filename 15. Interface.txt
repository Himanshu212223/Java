 	- Interface is like abstract, but, in interface, only static or default methods can 
 		have their definition or implementation, all other methods should be abstract 
 		only and their definition  or implementation is allowed in their child class.
 		
 	-	Any method declared without abstract keyword will automatically becomes 
 		abstract method.
 		
 	-	implements is used in place of extends to implement or inherit the interface.
 	
 	-	a class can implements multiple interface.
