# Spring Data JPA



## ORM

- It stands for Object Relational Mapping.
- It is a technique used to map Java Class Objects to Database Tables.
- Consider a Java Class User and a Database table users, ORM Frameworks like Hibernate can map the fields in the User class to Columns in the Users Table making it easy to perform CRUD operations.




## What is Hibernate or Open JPA ?

- It is a way (set of rules or Framework) to achieve ORM includes interfaces and Annotations that you use in your Java classes and requires a persistence provider **(ORM tools)** for implementation.

- To use JPA, you need a persistence provider (Hibernate, OpenJPA, etc).




## JPA or Java Persistence API

- It is a Java specification (part of Java EE, now Jakarta EE) that defines how to manage relational data in Java applications using object-relational mapping (ORM).

- Instead of writing a lot of raw SQL queries and JDBC code, JPA lets you interact with the database using Java objects (entities).

- JPA uses Hibernate or other which internally use Hibernate to perform operation with DB.

- Spring JPA act as an abstraction layer on top of Hibernate and other frameworks and provide some out of the box implementation of operations.





## Spring Data JPA

- It is built on top of the JPA specifications but not a JPA implementation itself.
- It is also designed for Relational Databases.



## JPA Architecture

### Entity

- Entity is the object which we map with the Table on DB.

### Entity Manager

- It is like a Interface which manages the Entities operation.

### Entity Manager Factory

- It is the provider which provides and manages Entity Manager.

### Persistance

- Persistance manages the configuration and create and provide Entity Manager Factory.


### Persistance Context

- It acts as a cache or memory / place where the Entities will be stored.
