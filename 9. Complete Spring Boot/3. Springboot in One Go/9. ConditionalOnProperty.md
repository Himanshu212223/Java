# ConditionalOnProperties - Manage too many Beans

- If the application contains too many Beans, then it would be difficult for the Spring Application to manage the Beans.

- So ConditionalOnProperties helps to solve this problem.

- It inject beans based on conditions.

```
@Component

@ConditionalOnProperty(
        prefix = "connecttocloud", 
        value = "enabled", 
        havingValue ="true" , 
        matchIfMissing = false
    )

public class ConnectToCloud {

    public ConnetToCloud () {
        ....
    }

}
```

So, How it works is it will look into `application.properties` file and tries to find `prefix.value` there.

Like in our case define above, the prefix.value is `connecttocloud.enabled`.

prefix.value = havingValue

ie.,
```
connecttocloud.enabled = true
```

To inject it - 

```
@Autowired(required = false)
ConnectToCloud connectToCloud ;
```

### Advantages - 

- Toggling of feature.
- Avoid Cluttering Application context with Unnecessary Beans.
- Save Memory
- Reduce Application Startup Time.

### Disadvantages - 

- Misconfiguration can happen.
- Code Complexity increases when over used.
- Complexity in managing.
