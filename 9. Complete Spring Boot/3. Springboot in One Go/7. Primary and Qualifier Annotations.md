# @Primary and @Qualifier Annotations

When we have an Interface and 2 different classes are implementing it then while creating the Bean of type interface Spring will get confused which one to use among 2.

Ex - 

Interface - 
```
public interface PaymentService {

}
```

Class 1 - 
```
@Service
public GpayService implements PaymentService {

    @Override
    public void processPayment( double amount ) {
        .....
    }
}
```

Class 2 - 
```
@Service
public UPIPayment implements PaymentService {

    @Override
    public void processPayment( double amount ) {
        .....
    }
}
```


Injection - 

```
@Service 
public class CheckoutService {

    @Autowired 
    PaymentService paymentService ;

    public void checkoutOrder ( double amount ) {
        paymentService.processPayment(amount) ;
    }
}
```


## @Qualifier Annotation

We can define the name of the Bean which we wants to inject.


```
@Service 
public class CheckoutService {

    @Autowired 
    @Qualifier("GpayService")
    PaymentService paymentService ;

    public void checkoutOrder ( double amount ) {
        paymentService.processPayment(amount) ;
    }
}
```



## @Primary Annotation

When we wants to inject a particular Bean as Default, we can use this Annotation.


Class 2 - 
```
@Service
@Primary
public UPIPayment implements PaymentService {

    @Override
    public void processPayment( double amount ) {
        .....
    }
}
```


```
@Service 
public class CheckoutService {

    @Autowired 
    PaymentService paymentService ;

    public void checkoutOrder ( double amount ) {
        paymentService.processPayment(amount) ;
    }
}
```
