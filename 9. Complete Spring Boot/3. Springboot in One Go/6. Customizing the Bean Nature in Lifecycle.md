    - DisposableBean
3. @PostConstructor and @PreDestroy annotations.


## 1. What are Custom Actions while Bean Creation ?

- It let the bean perform certain actions upon initialization and destruction of your Beans.
- Perform Actions After Bean Creation.
- Perform Actions Before Destroying Bean.




## 2. Interfaces to customize bean Nature

Spring provides some pre-defined Interfaces which we just needs to implement it and implement its methods.

### InitializingBean

It helps to perform some actions just after creation of Beans.

```
@Service
public class ProductService implements InitializingBean {

    private final ProductRepository productRepository ; 

    @Autowired
    public ProductService ( ProductRepository productRepository ) {
        this.productRepository = productRepository ;
    }

    @Override
    public void afterPropertiesSet () thows Exception {
        .....
        System.out.println("This will run just after Beans are created");
    }

}
```


### DisposableBean

It helps to perform some actions just before destruction of Beans.

```
@Service
public class ProductService implements InitializingBean DisposableBean {

    private final ProductRepository productRepository ; 

    @Autowired
    public ProductService ( ProductRepository productRepository ) {
        this.productRepository = productRepository ;
    }

    @Override
    public void afterPropertiesSet () thows Exception {
        .....
        System.out.println("This will run just after Beans are created");
    }

    @Override
    public void destroy () throws Exception {
        .....
        System.out.println("This will run just before the Beans are destroyed");
    }

}
```


## 3. @PostConstructor and @PreDestroy annotations.

The new way of performing the same action is using `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` Annotations.

```
@Service
public class ProductService {

    private final ProductRepository productRepository ; 

    @Autowired
    public ProductService ( ProductRepository productRepository ) {
        this.productRepository = productRepository ;
    }

    @PostConstruct
    public void runAfterBeanIsCreated () {
        .....
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void runBeforeDestroyMyBean () {
        ......
    }

}
```
